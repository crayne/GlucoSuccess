<p>GlucoSuccess will also ask about some information that requires a brief task away from the iPhone, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Checking and entering your finger-stick blood glucose values</li>
  <li>Your weight</li>
  <li>Your waist circumference (occasionally)</li>
</ul>
<p>GlucoSuccess provides personalized feedback in the form of g raphs and text to display your progress, and provide insights into your health behaviors. The app summarizes data about how   food or exercise patterns are associated with your glucose  values.  These insights may help you understand your health behaviors better, and help you manage your type 2 diabetes. Viewing the graphs and text is optional but may be useful or interesting to you.</p>
<p>For the passive sensing of your physical activity to be accurate, it&rsquo;s important to carry your iPhone on your person (e.g., in your pocket, or clipped to your waist).</p>
<p>In your Profile within GlucoSuccess, you can set   reminders for yourself to  complete app activities. In general,  more data  entered  in the app results in  more accurate and informative  insights.</p>
