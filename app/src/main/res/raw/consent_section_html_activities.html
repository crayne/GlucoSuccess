 	<p>GlucoSuccess  provides personalized insights into how your health behaviors relate to finger-stick blood glucose values, to help you manage your type 2 diabetes. In general,  richer data  entered  into the app results in  more accurate and informative  insights.</p>
<p>To drive these insights, GlucoSuccess will ask you to: </p>
<ul style="padding-left:20px;">
  <li>Answer survey questions about your type 2 diabetes and health behaviors (described more in a subsequent screen)  </li>
  <li>Log your finger-stick glucose values</li>
  <li>Log what you eat, as best as you can. We will ask you to log your meals using the free app &ldquo;Lose It!&rdquo;, which will provide nutritional information to GlucoSuccess.</li>
</ul>
<p>The app  sends  occasional reminders to  complete study activities.</p>
