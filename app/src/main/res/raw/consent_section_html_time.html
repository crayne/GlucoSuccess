<p>Entering  information and responding to surveys should take on average a few minutes each day. Occasionally, tasks may take a little longer (e.g., a longer questionnaire). </p>
<p>Participation in this study does not require you to change anything related to your iPhone account or data plan. The app can use either an existing mobile data plan or WiFi connections; you may configure the app to use only WiFi connections if you wish to limit impact on your data usage. </p>
<p>If you choose to participate, this study lasts for one year. After one year, your app data will no longer be analyzed as part of the study; however, you are free to continue using the app for the personal insights if you wish.</p>
As with any iPhone app, use your common sense and follow prevailing laws  about when and where you use your iPhone. Just as you would not text while driving, do not interact with the app while driving or doing any other activities which could result in injury. You can always wait until you are in a safe place to perform any app-related tasks.
