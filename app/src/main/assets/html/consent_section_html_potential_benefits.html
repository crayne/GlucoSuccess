<p>One of the biggest challenges for people with type 2 diabetes is the difficulty of tracking their finger-stick blood glucose values, diet, exercise and other health behaviors. GlucoSuccess may help by streamlining these daily tracking tasks.</p>
<p>GlucoSuccess will also provide personalized insights and feedback to help you understand how your health behaviors can influence your glucose values. This may help you manage your type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>More generally, patients with type 2 diabetes may ultimately benefit from this research, because GlucoSuccess and its research study will create an unprecedented crowd-sourced database of health behaviors and glucose values from people just like you. Studying all this real-world data will help researchers better understand the relationships between diet, exercise, and glucose control in real-world people with type 2 diabetes. It will also help explore how the iPhone can enable new kinds of clinical research.</p>
