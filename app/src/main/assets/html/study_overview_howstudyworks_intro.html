  <h1>How the Study Works</h1>
        	<p>GlucoSuccess has several user-friendly features:</p>
              
              <ul style="padding-left:20px;">
              <li><boldie>Log your finger-stick blood glucose values:</boldie> you can specify what days or what times of day you check your glucose, and set reminders.</li>
        	  <li><boldie>Log your health behaviors:</boldie> we’ll ask you to use the free “Lose It!” app to track your diet. Survey questions will periodically ask you about taking your medicines, how you are sleeping, foot inspections, and your overall quality of life.</li>
        	  <li><boldie>Track your physical activity:</boldie> your iPhone’s accelerometer will do this automatically for you! Just remember to carry your iPhone with you (e.g., in your pants pocket, or a holster clipped to your waist).</li>
        	  <li><boldie>Insights into your glucose control:</boldie> GlucoSuccess uses visualizations and text summaries to display how your diet and physical activity affect your blood glucose. GlucoSuccess also gives you insights into your food choices.</li>
           		</ul>
        	<p>GlucoSuccess encrypts your data, separates it from your identity, and adds your data to a secure research database. This will create an unprecedented crowd-sourced database of health behaviors and glucose values from people just like you. Studying all this real-world data will help researchers better understand the complex relationships between diet, exercise, and glucose control in type 2 diabetes. It will also help explore how the iPhone can enable new kinds of clinical research. </p>
        	<p>Because GlucoSuccess is both an app and a research study, we will explain the risks and benefits of the study as part of an informed consent process.</p>
