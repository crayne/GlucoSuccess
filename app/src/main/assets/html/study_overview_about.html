   <p>Welcome to GlucoSuccess! This app is part of an exciting new program to use the iPhone to advance clinical research into type 2 diabetes, while also helping you manage your diabetes. </p>
   <p>GlucoSuccess helps you keep track of health behaviors important for people with type 2 diabetes, such as physical activity, diet, and taking your medicines. Data that you share through the app as part of a research study will help researchers understand how health behaviors influence blood glucose in real life, with a resolution greater than ever before. At the same time, the app provides personalized insights into how your daily diet and physical activity relate to your finger-stick blood glucose values, and helps you manage your type 2 diabetes. </p>
   <p>The sponsor of this study is the Center for Assessment Technology and Continuous Health (CATCH) at the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts).</p>
