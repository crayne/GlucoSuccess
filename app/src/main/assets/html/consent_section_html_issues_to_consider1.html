<p>Any information you provide is completely up to you. You can decline to answer survey questions or participate in the app&rsquo;s tasks. If a survey question makes you feel uncomfortable, you are free to leave questions blank. </p>
<p>In general, more data entered into the app results in more accurate and informative personalized insights.</p>
<p>As with any iPhone app, use your common sense and follow prevailing laws about when and where you use your iPhone. Just as you would not text while driving, do not interact with the app while driving or doing any other activities which could result in injury. You can always wait until you are in a safe place to perform any app-related tasks.</p>
